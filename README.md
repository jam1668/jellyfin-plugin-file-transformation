## Introduction
File Transformation is a Jellyfin Plugin that can be used to modify the served [jellyfin-web](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-web) content without having to modify the files directly.

The use cases for this can be seen in my other plugins [plugin-pages](https://github.com/IAmParadox27/jellyfin-plugin-pages) and [home-sections](https://github.com/IAmParadox27/jellyfin-plugin-home-sections) which both take advantage of this.

### Credit
The original code and concept for this plugin came from this [Pull Request](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin/pull/9095) from [JPVenson](https://github.com/JPVenson). A lot of the code is unmodified (bar personal code standards).

### Benefits

> Why would I use this rather than just asking installers to change the files?

Well, this plugin is non destructive and allows multiple plugins to manipulate the served data. The install remains clean and free for users to update their Jellyfin server whenever they want.

## Installation

1. Add `https://www.iamparadox.dev/jellyfin/plugins/manifest.json` as a plugin source repository on your Jellyfin server.
2. Find "File Transformation" in the list and install it. No configuration is required.


#### 🐳 Docker Installation Notes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are on a docker install it is highly advisable to have [file-transformation](https://github.com/IAmParadox27/jellyfin-plugin-file-transformation) at least v2.2.1.0 installed. It helps avoid permission issues while modifying index.html


If you're running Jellyfin through Docker, the plugin may not have permission to modify jellyfin-web to inject the script. If you see permission errors such as `'System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access to the path '/usr/share/jellyfin/web/index.html' is denied.` in your logs, you will need to map the `index.html` file manually:

1. Copy the index.html file from your container:

   ```bash
   docker cp jellyfin:/usr/share/jellyfin/web/index.html /path/to/your/jellyfin/config/index.html
   ```

2. Add a volume mapping to your Docker run command:

   ```yaml
   -v /path/to/your/jellyfin/config/index.html:/usr/share/jellyfin/web/index.html
   ```

3. Or for Docker Compose, add this to your volumes section:
   ```yaml
   services:
     jellyfin:
       # ... other config
       volumes:
         - /path/to/your/jellyfin/config:/config
         - /path/to/your/jellyfin/config/index.html:/usr/share/jellyfin/web/index.html
         # ... other volumes
   ```

This gives the plugin the necessary permissions to inject JavaScript into the web interface.

### Prerequisites
| Plugin Version | Jellyfin Version  |
|----------------|-------------------|
| 2.0.0          | 10.10.5           |

### Referencing this as a library
Due to issues with Jellyfin's plugins being loaded into different load contexts this cannot be referenced directly. 

Instead you can send an HTTP POST request to `http(s)://{YOUR_JELLYFIN_URL}/FileTransformation/RegisterTransformation` with a body in the following format
```json
{
  "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000", // Guid,
  "fileNamePattern": "", // Regex Pattern for the file to patch
  "transformationEndpoint": "/YourPluginController/TransformEndpoint" // An endpoint on your plugin that will accept the content and mutate it.
}
```

When your transformation endpoint is requested you will receive a POST request with the following json format
```json
{
  "contents": "" // String containing the current state of the file being requested.
}
```

## Requests
If any functionality is desired to be overridden from Jellyfin's server please open a `feature-request` issue on GitHub.
